## How to use the Amazon AWS SDK for Textract with PHP 8.1 ##

First, review my [notes for using Textract with PHP 7.2](https://github.com/fullStackOasis/php-aws-textract-pdf/). Everything is pretty much the same when you use 8.1. The exception is that your PHP libraries will be for AWS SDK PHP 8.1. The code sample looks different too. You can find it in this demo - textract_demo_async.php.
